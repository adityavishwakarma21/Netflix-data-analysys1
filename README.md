# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis & Visualization using Python

Hey there!  
This is a basic data analysis project I worked on using a Netflix dataset. I mainly used Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for this. The goal was to explore the content available on Netflix and find some interesting patterns and insights.

---

## 🔍 What I Did

- I started by loading and cleaning the dataset.
- Removed duplicates and missing values.
- Analyzed things like:
  - Total number of Movies vs TV Shows
  - Top genres and their trends
  - Country-wise content distribution
  - Content added over the years
  - Most frequent actors/directors
  
I used visualizations to make the analysis easier to understand. Most graphs are done using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## 📁 Dataset Info

- I used the publicly available **Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset** (you can find it on Kaggle).
- It includes details like title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, genre, etc.

## 💡 Key Insights

- Netflix has more movies than TV shows overall.
- The most common genre is Drama.
- The majority of Netflix content comes from the United States and India.
- A major increase in content addition started around 2016–2017.
- Some actors and directors appear very frequently in the listings.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install required libraries if not already installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

3. Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run the cells step by step.

📌 Why I Built This

I wanted to practice data analysis using a real-world dataset. Netflix is something most of us use, so this dataset was relatable and fun to explore.
