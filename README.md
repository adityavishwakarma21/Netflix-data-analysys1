# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis & Visualization using Python

This is a one-day data analysis project where I explored the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset using Python. The goal was to generate meaningful insights and visualizations by analyzing the type of content, its country-wise distribution, yearly trends, and top genres.

## 📌 Key Objectives

- Analyze distribution between Movies and TV Shows on Netflix.
- Identify top 10 countries contributing content.
- Visualize yearly trends of new content added to Netflix.
- Determine the top genres dominating Netflix's library.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

- Movies vs TV Shows count  
- Country-wise content distribution  
- Year-wise addition trend  
- Top 10 genres by frequency  

(You can check the images in the `/outputs` or generated directly via the script.)
